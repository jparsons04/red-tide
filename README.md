# Red Tide

Red Tide is a parser-based science fiction narrative written in Inform 7. A solemn meditation on the limits of endurance.

This island is all there is, all that is left, all that is known. In this cramped mess of concrete and ingenuity, whatever semblance of normalcy we've scrounged for ourselves balances precariously on a knife's edge.

## Development

Red Tide is currently being developed in Inform 7 10.1.2
